## What is REST API?

Rest API is a way to communicate between clients (browsers, native app and more) and Server. When a clients request a data from the server the server send data through REST API and the REST API data can be use by any programming language or environment. So REST API make's a flexible way give us data and then clients (browsers, native app and others) can use that data with their perspectives. 

Previously Servers give's us HTML, CSS and JavaScript data as request which is not standard as day by day we have increase multiple devices and environment where language is very different to device to device. So the REST API solve this issue just give's us only Representational State data. 

## Six constrains of REST API
